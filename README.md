# System E

Ansible stuff that gets a new machine set up for me. This is supposed to be my bare minimum set up (ZSH Powerline10k etc). Should not be setting up loads of language stuff.

> Prefer working build over completeness

> Prefer Simplicity over Complexity

> Prefer stability over speed

## Todo list
- [x] Set up Ansible playbooks in tasks folder
- [x] Set up test bed with Docker
- [ ] Create task for installing the font (MesloLGS)
- [ ] Create task for installing basic deps

- [ ] Create task for porting configurations
